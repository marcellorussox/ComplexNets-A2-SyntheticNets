## üìÜ Project Overview

This repository explores how well different community detection algorithms can uncover the ground-truth communities of synthetic networks generated via the **Stochastic Block Model (SBM)**.

All networks share the following core parameters:

- **N = 300** nodes  
- **nblocks = 5** communities (each of 60 nodes)  
- **prs = 0.02** inter-block connection probability  
- **prr** (intra-block connection probability) varies across networks

Each network is named using the format:  
`synthetic_network_N_300_blocks_5_prr_<value>_prs_0.02.net`

## üîç Objective

1. Detect communities using **three algorithms**:
   - [`Infomap`](https://www.mapequation.org/)
   - [`Louvain`](https://github.com/vtraag/python-louvain)
   - [`Leiden`](https://github.com/vtraag/leidenalg) (or similar modularity-based algorithm)
2. Compare the detected partitions against the **ground-truth** using:
   - **Jaccard Index**
   - **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**
   - **Normalized Variation of Information (NVI)**
3. Evaluate **modularity (Q)** and number of communities as a function of `prr`
4. Provide **color-coded visualizations** for networks with:
   - `prr = 0.02`
   - `prr = 0.16`
   - `prr = 1.00`

Node positions are determined once using a layout algorithm (e.g. Fruchterman-Reingold) on `prr = 1.00`, and reused to ensure consistent spatial reference.

## üìì How to Use This Notebook

Simply open the main notebook and run it cell by cell:

üìÅ `ComplexNets-A2-SyntheticNets.ipynb`

Make sure the network files are in the appropriate `data/` folder.

You can execute the notebook in:
- Jupyter Lab / Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code (with Python Jupyter extension)
- Google Colab (upload data first)

All computations, visualizations, and metrics are handled interactively within the notebook itself.

## üß¨ Methodology

- **Synthetic Networks** are generated or loaded based on SBM with predefined `prr` values.
- **Community Detection** is performed on each network using all specified algorithms.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Jaccard Index**: Overlap of predicted vs true communities.
  - **Normalized Mutual Information**: Similarity of the clustering distributions.
  - **Normalized Variation of Information**: Distance between the partitions.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Node positions fixed using the layout of the `prr = 1.00` network
  - Color-coded communities for each algorithm
  - Side-by-side comparison

## üß† Discussion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è On Modularity Limitations

> "Does Q = 0.4 imply strong community structure?"

Modularity has inherent resolution limits and can show high values even in random networks and is sensitive to resolution limits and network density. A modularity of 0.4 could emerge in sparse random graphs or be an artifact of the algorithm's bias. Thus, modularity should be interpreted **in context**, not in isolation.

### üîç Algorithm Comparison

- **Infomap** often detects more granular communities, especially in low-prr networks.
- **Modularity-based** methods like Louvain/Leiden may merge or over-split due to resolution limitations.
- Performance varies drastically with network density (`prr`), confirming the importance of multi-metric evaluations.
