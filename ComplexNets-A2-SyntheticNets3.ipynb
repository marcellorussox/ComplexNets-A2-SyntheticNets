    "\n",
    "**Q1: What are the limitations of modularity as a metric for evaluating community detection results?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity-based algorithms (Louvain, Greedy) suffer from the **resolution limit**: in large networks, small but well-formed communities may be merged into larger ones if doing so increases the overall modularity. As a result, meaningful small-scale structures can be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, modularity may be **misleading in random networks**: even networks generated without any community structure (Erdős-Rényi) can exhibit relatively high modularity values due to random fluctuations. This makes it dangerous to rely solely on Q to infer the presence of meaningful communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Can we state that a network with Q=0.4 has community structure? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the observations previously made, although a modularity value of 0.4 might indicate a certain degree of community structure, this alone is not a reliable indicator.\n",

    "### 6.2 Observations on Differences between Algorithms\n",
    "This section provides a set of discussion questions aimed at analyzing the behavior of the three algorithms across different levels of noise (`prr`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: What is the difference between Louvain, Greedy and Infomap Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "MLouvain and Greedy are both modularity-based algorithms, but they differ in their strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Louvain** is a hierarchical algorithm that works in two main steps. First, it performs local modularity optimization by moving individual nodes into neighboring communities if it increases modularity. Then, it aggregates nodes belonging to the same community into a supernode and repeats the process on this new, compressed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy**, is an agglomerative approach. It starts with each node in its own community and iteratively merges the pair of communities that leads to the highest increase in modularity. This process continues until all nodes are merged into a single community, and the division with the best modularity score is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infomap**, in contrast, is not based on modularity. It takes a dynamic perspective: it simulates a random walker moving across the network and finds the partition that minimizes the expected description length of its trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Are the modularity values obtained equal? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, the modularity values obtained by the three algorithms are not always equal, and this is expected due to fundamental differences in how they operate.\n",
    "  - Louvain and Greedy explicitly optimize modularity, so they generally produce higher modularity values. As prr increases, indicating stronger and more detectable community structure, the modularity increase\n",
    "  - Infomap, on the other hand, is not based on modularity but on minimizing the description length of a random walk. As a result, the modularity of its partitions is not necessarily high and can even be unstable for low values of prr. This is visible in the plot, where infomap shows low modularity where prr is between 0.0 and 0.2, suggesting that its partitioning at that range doeas not align with what modularity considers optimal."
